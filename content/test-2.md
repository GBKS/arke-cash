Arké runs on a test network called signet, which uses test bitcoin that have no value. It's specifically for testing. Let's get some of those worthless test bitcoin into your wallet.

##### 2.1: Navigate to "Send"

Contacts are accessible via the **Send** view. The button currently shows an avatar of a dog. Once you create more contacts and add their images, this button will update accordingly.

##### 2.2: Find Faucetto Signetto

Open Arké and navigate to your contacts. You'll see a default contact called **Faucetto Signetto**. This is your test bitcoin source.

##### 2.3: Request test bitcoin

Open the Faucetto Signetto contact and tap **Ask for test bitcoin** to ask for test bitcoin. They will automatically send a small amount to your wallet.

There's a delay before you can request again. You are welcome to make multiple requests if you need them for testing, but please don't drain all of Faucetto's hard-earned test bitcoin.

##### 2.4: Wait for confirmation

Return to the **Activity** view and wait for the transaction to arrive. You can pull down to refresh. This should take just a few minutes. You'll see your payments balance update once it arrives.

If this does not work, then we probably ran out of test bitcoin. [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/THhNW5H26H), we'll make sure to help you there. 

At this early stage, things might also break for other reasons. If they do, please let us know and we'll try to fix them right away.
