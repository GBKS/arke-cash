# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: January 25, 2026**

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Arké ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## Description of Service

Arké is a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet application that implements the Ark protocol. The App provides software that allows you to:

- Generate and manage Bitcoin wallets
- Send and receive Bitcoin
- Interact with the Ark protocol for Bitcoin transactions
- Store wallet data securely on your device using Apple Keychain and iCloud

## Self-Custody and Your Responsibilities

### You Control Your Wallet

This is a self-custodial wallet. This means:

- **You alone** control your private keys and recovery phrase
- **We never have access** to your private keys, recovery phrase, or funds
- **We cannot** freeze, seize, or control your Bitcoin in any way
- **We cannot** reverse, cancel, or modify any transactions you make
- **We cannot** recover your wallet if you lose your recovery phrase

### Your Responsibilities

By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for:

1. **Securing your recovery phrase** — Write it down and store it in a safe, offline location. Anyone with access to your recovery phrase can access your funds.

2. **Securing your device** — Use a strong passcode, enable biometric authentication, and keep your device's operating system updated.

3. **Securing your Apple ID** — Your iCloud backup (if enabled) is protected by your Apple ID. Use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication.

4. **Maintaining backups** — Ensure you have a secure backup of your recovery phrase before storing any significant value.

5. **Verifying transaction details** — Always verify recipient addresses and amounts before confirming transactions. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.

6. **Understanding the technology** — You are responsible for understanding how Bitcoin, the Ark protocol, and self-custodial wallets work.

### No Recovery Possible

**IMPORTANT:** If you lose your recovery phrase and lose access to your device, your Bitcoin will be permanently lost. We have no ability to recover your funds under any circumstances. There is no "forgot password" option.

## Risks

### Cryptocurrency Risks

You acknowledge that:

- **Price volatility** — The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate dramatically. You may lose some or all of the value of your holdings.

- **Regulatory uncertainty** — Cryptocurrency regulations vary by jurisdiction and may change. You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.

- **Technical risks** — Software may contain bugs. While we strive for quality, no software is perfect.

- **Network risks** — The Bitcoin network and Ark protocol operate independently of us. Network congestion, protocol changes, or failures could affect your ability to transact.

- **Irreversibility** — Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. If you send Bitcoin to the wrong address, it may be permanently lost.

### Ark Protocol Risks

The Ark protocol involves specific considerations:

- Ark is a relatively new protocol and may have undiscovered vulnerabilities
- Interacting with Ark service providers requires trust in those operators
- Protocol upgrades or changes could affect functionality
- Liquidity and availability of Ark services may vary

### No Investment Advice

Nothing in the App or these Terms constitutes financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Consult qualified professionals before making financial decisions.

## Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the App to:

- Violate any applicable laws or regulations

You may stop using the App at any time. We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.
