# Test 4: Send and receive with others

Now let's exchange bitcoin with other testers. You'll need to join the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/THhNW5H26H) for this.

##### 4.1: Share your address on Discord

Navigate to the **Receive** tab. You will see your addresses in the form of a QR code here, for easy sharing on-the-go.

##### 4.2 Copy your address

The toggle at the top of the **Receive** tab switches between the QR code (great for scanning with a camera) and the direct display of your addresses (great for sharing in text form). You can also tap the **Receive** tab again to switch between the views.

Now copy your **Payments address**. Head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/THhNW5H26H), share this address, and ask someone to send you some test bitcoin.

##### 4.3: Create a contact for your testing partner

Once you have received a payment from someone, create a contact for them. This helps you keep your activity list organized.

Now send them some bitcoin back to return the favour.
