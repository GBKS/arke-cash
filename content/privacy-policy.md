# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 25, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Arké ("we," "our," or "the App") handles information when you use our self-custodial Bitcoin wallet application.

We built this app with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers because we do not operate servers that interact with your wallet data.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, track, or have access to:

- Your name, email address, or contact information
- Your Bitcoin addresses or transaction history
- Your wallet balances
- Your private keys or recovery phrases
- Your IP address or location data
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Any other personally identifiable information

## How Your Data Is Stored

Arké is a fully self-custodial wallet. All sensitive data remains entirely on your device and within your personal Apple ecosystem:

**On-Device Storage**
- Your wallet data is stored locally on your device
- Private keys are secured using Apple's Keychain Services, which provides hardware-backed encryption

**iCloud (If Enabled)**
- If you have iCloud enabled, encrypted wallet data may be backed up to your personal iCloud account
- This backup is tied to your Apple ID and protected by your iCloud security settings
- We have no access to your iCloud account or any data stored within it
- You can disable iCloud backup for this app in your device settings

## Third-Party Services

**Apple Platform Services**

The App uses Apple's platform services (Keychain and iCloud) for secure storage. Apple's handling of this data is governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

**Ark Protocol**

The App implements the Ark protocol for Bitcoin transactions. When you make transactions, data is broadcast to the Bitcoin network and Ark service providers as necessary to complete your transactions. Transaction data broadcast to these networks becomes part of the public blockchain or is processed by Ark operators you choose to interact with.

**No Analytics or Tracking**

We do not integrate any third-party analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or tracking services.

## Bitcoin Network

When you send or receive Bitcoin, transaction information is broadcast to the decentralized Bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public blockchain. This is inherent to how Bitcoin works and is not within our control.

## Your Responsibilities

As a self-custodial wallet, you are solely responsible for:

- Securing your device and Apple ID
- Safeguarding your recovery phrase
- Managing your iCloud and Keychain security settings
- Maintaining backups of your wallet

If you lose access to your device and recovery phrase, we cannot help you recover your funds.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under 17 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.
