# Test 3: Make your first payments

Now let's practice sending bitcoin in two different ways (using Ark and the Lightning Network respectively).

##### 3.1: Send bitcoin back to Faucetto Signetto

Practice sending by returning some test bitcoin to Faucetto Signetto. Open the contact and tap **Send**, then choose an amount. This helps recycle test funds for other testers.

##### 3.3: Buy a treat for Byte

Visit this [test pet store](https://signet.2nd.dev/store){target=_blank} and buy some virtual treats for Byte, the mascot of the Second team.

Here we test making a payment over the lightning network, which Arké is fully interoperable with.
