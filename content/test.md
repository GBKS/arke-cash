## Join the community

Before you start, [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/THhNW5H26H). It's where testers share feedback, ask questions, and find partners for send/receive testing. You'll need a testing partner later in this guide, and it's helpful to have the community available if you get stuck.

## Known issues

The following features are incomplete or not working in this build:

- **Onchain transactions don't appear in activity**: Deposits and onchain sends won't show in your transaction history yet. Your balance will update correctly, but the individual transactions aren't listed.
- **Some fees may be 0**: Some fees are simpley not implemented or finalized yet.
- **No choice of Ark server:** Eventually, we want you to be able to choose between different servers. At this early stage, there simply aren't any other ones than the signet one by Second.
