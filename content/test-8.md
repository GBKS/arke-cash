# Test 8: Recover your payments balance

Your payments balance, and payments with that balance, are facilitated by a third-party Ark server. The can never take your bitcoin, but they could potentially refuse payments, or shut down.

If that happens, you can recover your payments balance without the server. Note that this takes some time and also involves a fee. It is meant for emergency situations.

##### 8.1: Recover your payments balance

In **Settings*, navigate to "Recover your payments balance". You'll see a quick summary of how this process works. Fees can be on the high side, so you may want to avoid testing with very small amounts.

##### 8.2: Follow the progress

A recovery can take a day or more. Three are multiple steps involved. You'll find a special entry in your **Activity* with the latest status.

##### 8.3: Confirm the withdrawal

The latest step involves withdrawing the bitcoin from your payments balance to your savings balance. This step requires an additional confirmation from you at the moment (this may change).
