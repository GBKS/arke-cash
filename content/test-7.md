# Test 7: Refresh your payments balance

As mentioned above, the **Payments** balance needs to be regularly refreshed, for the benefit of instant, low-fee transactions.

In our test setup (using the signet network), a refresh is needed every 24 hours. Once Arké (and the Ark protocol) are live, this will be increased to a month.

##### 7.1: Look out for a refresh indicator

The balance card on the **Activity** screen will show an indicator if it's the time to refresh is coming up.

##### 7.2: Navigate to the refresh options

When the time is right, navigate to your balance details and tap the **Refresh** button.

##### 7.3: Start the refresh

Start the refresh process in the modal. While this happens, some or all of your funds may be locked. This process should not take too long.

If this fails, please try again. At this early test, things can be a little shaky at times.
